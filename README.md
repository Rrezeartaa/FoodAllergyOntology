# FoodAllergyOntology

This project was implemented as an assignment in "Semantic Web" subject.
The purpose of this project is to build an ontology through which classification of food is done
based on different kinds of allergies, diets and their origin. The main purpose of this ontology is
to suggest food/recipes for people that are allergic, that want to lose or gain weight and also to
give different statistics about food.
